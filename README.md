This project demonstrates how to upload files (intentionally restricted to images in this example) to AWS S3 bucket using a web application developed using Spring Boot and React.js

The only changes required to reproduce result are as follows:
1. Access keys and secret from AWS account
2. Ensure you pull code from aws-image-upload-frontend repository as it represents the frontend of the application.
